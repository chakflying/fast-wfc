# fast-wfc

An implementation of [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) with a focus on performance.
At the time of writing, only the overlapping method has been implemented.

This fork attempts to get non-square tiles working.

## Requirements

You need to have Visual Studio 2017 installed as the c++ compiler and linker in MSVC is used.
The build process is tested on Windows only.

## Getting started

This fork is built around using Visual Studio Code as the main development tool. Executable can be built after configuring the build tasks defined in the .bat files.

## Third-parties library

The files in `src/lib/` come from:

* RapidXML [https://github.com/dwd/rapidxml](https://github.com/dwd/rapidxml)
* stb Library [https://github.com/nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
